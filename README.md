# Kanji-Study-App
This is an app where users can study kanji by selecting their selection of cards that they must try guess the right kanji by speeling out the kanji. 
This project is a more personal project but also helps me to use typescript and tailwind within a bigger project to help me get a better understanding of them within a production build. 

## Tools

React, 
Typescript, 
Tailwindcss, 
Kanji API (Not sure yet might just use a json file), 

## Idea from these sites
I liked how they tested out your hiragana and katakana on this sight and i wanted a simular one for kanji.

On this site I do most my kanji study and wanted a bit different way to study from the usual flash card design.
